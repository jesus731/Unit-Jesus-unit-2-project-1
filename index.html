        One of the biggest things about chicago is the amount of shootings there is yearly some stats say that between the start of last year and the end of last december there was at least 3,258 people shot. The number has gone up ever since

            <h1> Why is there shootings</h1>
        </div>
           <!-- PUT INFO AND IMAGES FOR SECTION 2 BELOW HERE -->
        Some of tne reasons why there is shootings not just in Chicago but all around the world is because of many different reasons. One of the reasons could be that someone is trying to get revenge on someone for doing some random stuff. Another thing is that because they are forced to do it if they are in a gang. There is many more reasons that don't make a lot of sense

        I think we should try and stop gun violence just because all the bad things that causes to everybody. It probably wont ever stop but atleast try and reduce the shooting per year.
